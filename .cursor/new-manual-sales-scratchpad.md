ah ok i see. this is going to fail in production because the commission was hardcoded in our script. there are a bunch of things we need to do. let's go back to planner mode in our manual-sales-debug file. 

1. we need to do a database migration and make the Commission Model match with our CommissionSchema in zod.
2. When a user signs up, automatically create a corresponding partner record. Link the User and Partner records through the PartnerUser relationship. Allow the user to enroll in programs as a partner. When creating links, associate them with both the userID and partnerID. This way, users can both track the sales they drove through their analytics, events, and links dashboards, and see their commission earnings in their Earnings dashboard just like a partner would. Right now the way we track commission earnings in the Earnings dashboard is just by taking all the commissions associated with a link that user created, rather than the commissions they specifically earned. We need to shift to the partner model because eventually, we want users to be able to split the commission from a sale with the buyer. In this case, a single sale will generate commissions for two different people, who will both have partner records (the user and the buyer). this is why it is critical for us to shift to the partner model.
2. when a link is created, it should create a programId deterministically as a function of the productUrl's baseURL and the commission percentage, which we should grab from our shopmy/api/data endpoint. For example, the programId could look like "cultgaia7" for the domain cultgaia.com and a 7% commission. This way, when someone creates a link, we can search to see if that programId exists already and enroll that user 
3. should also store
