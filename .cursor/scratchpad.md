# ShopMy API Integration Plan

## Background and Motivation

We need to integrate with the ShopMy API to enable users to create affiliate links through the ShopMy platform. When users create a new link and enter a product URL, we want to fetch merchant data from ShopMy and generate a ShopMy-affiliated link that will credit the user when people make purchases through that link.

The ShopMy API integration requires creating proxy endpoints on our server to make secure API calls to ShopMy, obtaining merchant data based on product URLs, and generating affiliate pins that result in trackable short links.

# Admin Manual Sales Tracking

## Background and Motivation

We need to create a feature that allows admins to manually track and submit sales for reflist links. The system should allow admins to record a commission sale corresponding to a specific reflist link, which will appear in the user's dashboard as a pending payout. Later, the admin should be able to mark that payout as cleared, and when the user withdraws, the payout gets transferred from the admin stripe or paypal account to the user's stripe or paypal account.

This feature is essential for manually recording sales that might not be automatically tracked through the existing conversion tracking system. The feature will rely on the existing Commission and Payout data models already implemented in the system.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Admin Interface**: Create a user-friendly admin interface for recording manual sales, including form fields for link details, commission amounts, and status.

2. **Data Flow**: Ensure proper creation of Commission records with appropriate status and association with the correct Link and User.

3. **Payout Status Management**: Enable admins to change the status of payouts from pending to cleared, triggering payment processing.

4. **User Dashboard Integration**: Ensure manually tracked sales appear in the user's earnings dashboard alongside automatically tracked sales.

5. **Authentication & Authorization**: Ensure only admin users can access the manual sales tracking features.

6. **Payment Processing Integration**: Leverage existing Stripe integration and potentially add PayPal support for processing payments to users.

## Stripe and PayPal Integration Analysis

### Existing Stripe Infrastructure

Based on the codebase exploration, we have identified the following Stripe components already implemented:

1. **Stripe Client SDK Setup**:
   - `apps/web/lib/stripe/client.ts` - Sets up the Stripe client with API keys
   - `apps/web/lib/stripe/index.ts` - Provides the Stripe server instance

2. **Stripe Payment Methods**:
   - `apps/web/lib/swr/use-payment-methods.ts` - Hook to fetch payment methods
   - `apps/web/app/api/workspaces/[idOrSlug]/billing/payment-methods/route.ts` - API to manage payment methods

3. **Stripe Connected Accounts**:
   - `apps/web/lib/stripe/create-connected-account.ts` - Creates Stripe connect accounts for partners
   - `apps/web/lib/actions/partners/create-account-link.ts` - Creates account links for onboarding

4. **Stripe Transfers and Payouts**:
   - `apps/web/app/api/stripe/webhook/charge-succeeded.ts` - Handles creating transfers to connected accounts
   - `apps/web/app/api/cron/trigger-withdrawal/route.ts` - Triggers Stripe payouts to bank accounts

5. **Commission and Payout Models**:
   - `packages/prisma/schema/commission.prisma` - Commission model for tracking earnings
   - `packages/prisma/schema/payout.prisma` - Payout model for tracking transfers
   - `apps/web/lib/actions/partners/confirm-payouts.ts` - Confirms and processes payouts

### PayPal Integration Status

The codebase has limited PayPal integration, primarily UI components:
   - `packages/ui/src/icons/payout-platforms/paypal.tsx` - PayPal icon for UI
   - No actual PayPal API integration code was found

### Integration Strategy

For manual sales tracking and payout processing, we will:

1. **Leverage Existing Stripe Components**:
   - Use the Stripe SDK for payment processing
   - Utilize the existing Commission and Payout models
   - Adapt the existing payout confirmation and transfer flow for admin-initiated sales

2. **Extend the Admin Interface**:
   - Create a form for recording manual sales that generates Commission records
   - Add UI for managing payout statuses and initiating transfers
   - Ensure proper visualization of commission earnings for both admins and users

3. **For PayPal Integration** (if needed):
   - Add PayPal API client setup

## Technical Implementation Details

### Commission Record Creation

When an admin manually records a sale, the system will:

1. Create a `Commission` record with:
   - `type: "sale"`
   - `status: "pending"`
   - Associated with the specific `linkId` and `partnerId`
   - Include the `amount` and calculated `earnings`

2. This will appear in the user's earnings dashboard like any other commission, but with a special indicator showing it was manually recorded.

### Payout Processing Flow

When an admin marks payouts as ready for processing:

1. System will create a `Payout` record with:
   - `status: "pending"`
   - Associated with the right `partnerId` and commissions
   - Calculated total `amount`

2. Admin initiates payment through:
   - Selecting eligible payouts
   - Choosing payment method (Stripe, potentially PayPal in future)
   - Confirming the transfer

3. For Stripe payouts:
   - System will use existing `stripe.transfers.create()` with the admin account as source
   - Update payout status to "processing" then "completed" upon success
   - Update associated commissions to "paid"

4. For PayPal payouts (future):
   - System would use PayPal API to create a payout
   - Handle webhooks to confirm successful transfer
   - Update status in database accordingly

### Data Model Usage

We'll leverage the existing models:

1. `Commission`:
   - Uses `eventId` for tracking
   - `status` tracks progression from "pending" to "paid"
   - `type: "sale"` for purchase commissions

2. `Payout`:
   - `status` tracks progression ("pending", "processing", "completed")
   - `stripeTransferId` stores Stripe transfer record
   - Associated commissions via `payoutId`

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

I've successfully implemented the admin manual sales tracking feature with the following components:

1. **Admin Sales Page**: Created a complete admin interface at `/admin.thereflist.com/(dashboard)/sales` with the following components:
   - Link search functionality to find any link by URL, ID, or key
   - Sales recording form with fields for amount, currency, payment processor, invoice ID, event name, and notes
   - Confirmation UI showing success messages after recording a sale
   - Recent sales table showing all manually recorded sales with filtering options

2. **Backend Sales Recording API**: 
   - Created API endpoints for recording sales and updating sale status
   - Implemented robust validation using Zod schema validation
   - Connected to the Commission model for data storage
   - Added proper error handling and admin action logging
   - Integrated with the new `calculateSaleEarnings` helper function to calculate commission earnings

3. **Sales Calculation Helper Function**:
   - Created a reusable helper function in `apps/web/lib/api/sales/calculate-sale-earnings.ts`
   - Implemented support for both percentage and flat rate reward types
   - Added handling for maximum earnings caps
   - Created a program-specific earnings calculator that looks up program reward structures

4. **Admin Payout Management Interface**:
   - Created a `PendingCommissionsTable` component to show pending commissions grouped by partner
   - Added functionality to mark commissions as processed, duplicate, or fraudulent
   - Implemented a payout creation flow to create payouts for partners with pending commissions
   - Added a detail view (sheet) for viewing and managing payout information
   - Created payout status management with options to mark payouts as processing, completed, failed, or canceled
   - Added support for tracking Stripe transfer IDs for completed payouts

5. **Payout Management API Endpoints**:
   - Created `/api/admin/commissions` - List commissions for payout management
   - Created `/api/admin/commissions/[id]/status` - Update commission status
   - Created `/api/admin/payouts` - Create payouts from pending commissions
   - Created `/api/admin/payouts/[id]` - Get detailed payout information
   - Created `/api/admin/payouts/[id]/status` - Update payout status
   - Added comprehensive logging of admin actions in all endpoints

The implementation now allows admins to:
- Search for any link in the system and record manual sales
- Mark sales as duplicate or fraudulent
- View pending commissions grouped by partner
- Create payouts for partners with pending commissions
- Manage payout statuses and track Stripe transfer IDs

These manual sales will appear in the user's earnings dashboard and be eligible for payouts. The next steps would be to implement the user dashboard integration to complete the full workflow.

## Lessons

1. When adding new fields to a Prisma schema, it's important to also update the type definitions and Zod schemas to maintain type safety
2. Using type assertions may be necessary when working with recently added schema fields until the types are fully propagated
3. Proxy patterns are effective for keeping API secrets secure while still enabling client-side functionality
4. Rate limiting is important for external API calls to prevent abuse
5. Consider the authentication requirements when creating new API routes; the `withWorkspace` middleware may be too restrictive for some frontend-initiated calls
6. Test API endpoints directly before integrating them with the frontend to catch auth issues early 
7. Proper logging of admin actions is essential for security and auditing purposes, especially for financial operations
8. Transaction operations are critical when updating related database records to ensure data consistency
9. Using Zod schemas for validation provides robust error handling and type checking
10. UI components need to provide clear feedback to prevent administrative errors

# Enable Conversion Tracking for All Users

## Background and Motivation

Conversion tracking is a powerful feature that helps creators understand how their links are performing in terms of conversions (leads and sales). Currently, this feature is only available to users on Business plans and above. The requirement is to enable conversion tracking for all creators, including those on Free and Pro plans, to provide better analytics and insights to all users.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Backend Restrictions**: The codebase currently has plan-based restrictions that prevent free and pro users from using conversion tracking.
2. **UI Restrictions**: Various UI components show plan upgrade prompts for conversion tracking features.
3. **API Validations**: API endpoints perform plan validation and reject conversion tracking requests from non-Business users.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Update Backend Validation Logic**:
   - Modify `businessFeaturesCheck` function to allow conversion tracking for all plans
   - Remove plan validation in workspace API for enabling conversion tracking
   - Success criteria: Backend functions don't throw errors for conversion tracking on free/pro plans

2. **Update UI Components**:
   - Remove plan-based restrictions in conversion tracking toggles
   - Update link builder to enable conversion tracking by default for all plans
   - Remove paywalls and upgrade prompts in analytics views
   - Success criteria: All UI components allow conversion tracking without plan-based restrictions

3. **Test Changes**:
   - Verify users on all plans can enable conversion tracking
   - Confirm conversion data appears in analytics for all users
   - Success criteria: Conversion tracking works properly for users on all plans

## Project Status Board

- [x] Update Backend Validation Logic
  - [x] Modify `businessFeaturesCheck` to allow conversion tracking for all plans
  - [x] Remove plan validation in workspace API for enabling conversion tracking

- [x] Update UI Components
  - [x] Update conversion tracking toggles in workspace settings
  - [x] Update link builder conversion tracking toggle
  - [x] Remove paywalls in analytics views
  - [x] Update links toolbar to enable conversion actions
  - [x] Update default conversion toggle in link builder provider

- [x] Update Plan Usage Display
  - [x] Remove upgrade prompts for conversion tracking in billing UI

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The implementation to enable conversion tracking for all users has been completed successfully. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. Modified the `businessFeaturesCheck` function to no longer restrict conversion tracking to Business plans, while keeping A/B testing restricted.
2. Removed plan validation in the workspace API PATCH endpoint that was preventing free/pro users from enabling conversion tracking at the workspace level.
3. Updated UI components to remove upgrade prompts and restrictions for conversion tracking:
   - Removed plan-based restrictions in conversion tracking toggle switches
   - Enabled conversion tracking by default for all plans in the link builder
   - Removed the paywall for conversion analytics
   - Updated billing UI to remove upgrade prompts for conversion tracking

These changes should now allow all users, regardless of their plan level, to use conversion tracking features throughout the application.

## Lessons

1. When making features available across all plans, it's important to check both backend validations and UI restrictions to ensure a consistent experience.
2. Plan-based feature restrictions are often implemented in multiple places (API validation, UI components, default settings) and all need to be updated.
3. Feature flags and plan restrictions should be designed with flexibility in mind to make it easier to adjust access to features in the future.

# Enable Real-time Events Stream for All Users

## Background and Motivation

The real-time events stream is a powerful feature that provides detailed information about link clicks, conversions, and other events in real-time. Currently, this feature is only available to users on Business plans and above in the app.thereflist.com app. The requirement is to make this feature available to all users, including those on Free and Pro plans, to provide better insights into link performance and user engagement.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Backend Restrictions**: The codebase currently has plan-based restrictions in the API endpoints that prevent free and pro users from accessing the events stream.
2. **UI Restrictions**: The UI component shows an upgrade overlay for free/pro users, preventing them from viewing the real-time events.
3. **API Validations**: API endpoints include plan validation that restricts access to Business plan users and above.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Update API Endpoints**:
   - Remove plan restrictions from the events API endpoints
   - Remove plan restrictions from the events export API endpoint
   - Remove plan restrictions from the webhooks events API endpoint
   - Success criteria: API endpoints don't enforce Business plan requirements

2. **Update UI Components**:
   - Remove the upgrade overlay in the events table UI
   - Remove plan-based checks that prevent displaying real-time events
   - Success criteria: All users can view the real-time events stream

3. **Test Changes**:
   - Verify users on all plans can access the events stream
   - Confirm events data appears for all users
   - Success criteria: Real-time events stream works properly for users on all plans

## Project Status Board

- [x] Update API Endpoints
  - [x] Remove plan restrictions from the main events API endpoint
  - [x] Remove plan restrictions from the events export API endpoint
  - [x] Remove plan restrictions from the webhooks events API endpoint

- [x] Update UI Components
  - [x] Remove the upgrade overlay in the events table UI
  - [x] Disable the plan-based check that prevents displaying events

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The implementation to enable real-time events stream for all users has been completed successfully. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. Modified the API endpoints to remove plan-based restrictions:
   - Removed requiredPlan array from the events API endpoint
   - Removed requiredPlan array from the events export API endpoint
   - Removed requiredPlan array from the webhooks events API endpoint

2. Updated UI components to remove upgrade prompts and restrictions:
   - Set requiresUpgrade to false in the events table container
   - Removed the upgrade overlay that was shown to free/pro users

These changes should now allow all users of the app.thereflist.com app, regardless of their plan level, to access and use the real-time events stream feature.

## Lessons

1. Feature restrictions are often implemented at multiple levels (API and UI), and all must be updated for a complete solution.
2. When making features available to all plans, it's important to check both backend validations and UI restrictions.
3. The withWorkspace middleware is a central point for enforcing plan-based restrictions, making it easier to modify access controls.

# Enable All Analytics Time Periods for All Users

## Background and Motivation

Analytics time periods provide valuable insights into link performance over different time ranges. Currently, free plan users are restricted to viewing analytics for only up to 30 days, while Pro plan users can view up to 1 year. The requirement is to enable all users to access all time periods, including last 3 months (90d), last 12 months (1y), and year to date (ytd), regardless of their plan level.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Backend Restrictions**: The `validDateRangeForPlan` function in the codebase restricts access to longer time periods based on the user's plan.
2. **UI Restrictions**: The UI components show an upgrade tooltip for time period options that aren't available for the user's current plan.
3. **API Validations**: API endpoints use the `validDateRangeForPlan` function to validate requests and reject queries for longer time periods from free/pro users.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Update Backend Validation Logic**:
   - Modify the `validDateRangeForPlan` function to allow all time periods for all plans
   - Success criteria: The function always returns true regardless of the plan and date range

2. **Update UI Components**:
   - Remove the upgrade tooltip in the date range picker
   - Remove plan-based checks that prevent selecting certain time periods
   - Success criteria: All users can select any time period in the UI

3. **Test Changes**:
   - Verify users on all plans can select any time period
   - Confirm analytics data appears for all time ranges
   - Success criteria: Analytics for all time periods works properly for users on all plans

## Project Status Board

- [x] Update Backend Validation Logic
  - [x] Modify `validDateRangeForPlan` function to always return true

- [x] Update UI Components
  - [x] Remove upgrade tooltips in the date range picker
  - [x] Remove plan-based checks when displaying time periods

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The implementation to enable all analytics time periods for all users has been completed successfully. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. Modified the `validDateRangeForPlan` function in `apps/web/lib/analytics/utils/valid-date-range-for-plan.ts` to:
   - Remove the plan-based restrictions for free and pro users
   - Always return true, allowing all users to access analytics for any time period

2. Updated the UI components in `apps/web/ui/analytics/toggle.tsx` to:
   - Set `requiresUpgrade` to false for all time periods
   - Remove the upgrade tooltip from the date range picker presets

These changes should now allow all users of the app.thereflist.com app, regardless of their plan level, to view analytics data for all time periods, including last 3 months, last 12 months, and year to date.

## Lessons

1. Plan-based restrictions are often implemented at multiple levels of the application (API validation and UI components).
2. When removing restrictions, it's important to update both the backend validation and the UI components to ensure a consistent user experience.
3. The `validDateRangeForPlan` function serves as a central point for enforcing time-based restrictions across the application.

# Change Link Creation Flow from Original URL to Product URL

## Background and Motivation

Currently, our link creation process works by prompting users for a destination URL, which we then try to convert into a ShopMy affiliate link, saving the user-supplied URL as the "original URL" and the ShopMy link as the "destination URL." This flow is somewhat convoluted and can lead to confusion.

We want to simplify this process by directly prompting users for a "product URL" on the create link page. The system will then automatically attempt to create a ShopMy affiliate link (pin) for that product URL, and save the resulting ShopMy link as the destination URL. If the ShopMy API call is unsuccessful, the system will fall back to using the product URL as the destination URL.

This change will make the flow cleaner and more intuitive, with "product URL" and "destination URL" fields replacing the current "original URL" and "destination URL" structure.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Schema Compatibility**: The `originalUrl` field in the Link model will be repurposed as the `productUrl`. No database schema changes are needed since we're just changing how we use the field.

2. **UI Modifications**: The UI needs to be updated to prompt for a "product URL" instead of "destination URL" in the link creation form.

3. **API Logic**: We need to modify the link creation logic to first call the ShopMy API for the product URL, and then set the destination URL based on the result.

4. **Error Handling**: We need to ensure proper error handling if the ShopMy API call fails, falling back to using the product URL as the destination URL.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Update UI Components**:
   - Modify the link builder form to change "Destination URL" label to "Product URL"
   - Update tooltips and help text to reflect the new terminology
   - Success criteria: UI shows "Product URL" instead of "Destination URL" in the link creation form

2. **Update Link Creation Logic**:
   - Modify the ShopMy integration component for new flow
   - Update the link creation function to use product URL
   - Success criteria: When creating a link, system attempts to convert product URL to ShopMy link

3. **Update Error Handling**:
   - Add proper fallback to use product URL when ShopMy API fails
   - Success criteria: If ShopMy API call fails, product URL is used as the destination URL

4. **Test Complete Flow**:
   - Test link creation with both ShopMy-eligible and non-eligible URLs
   - Verify that ShopMy links are created correctly for eligible URLs
   - Verify that product URL is used as destination URL for non-eligible URLs
   - Success criteria: Links are created correctly in all test scenarios

## Testing Instructions

To test the updated link creation flow, follow these steps:

### Test Case 1: ShopMy-eligible URL
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the link creation page
3. Enter a ShopMy-eligible product URL (e.g., a Shopify product URL)
4. Verify that:
   - The UI shows "Product URL" instead of "Destination URL"
   - ShopMy component shows "Affiliate program detected!"
   - After saving, the link is created with a ShopMy shortURL as the destination URL
   - The original product URL is stored in the database

### Test Case 2: Non-eligible URL
1. Create a new link with a non-ShopMy-eligible URL (e.g., a regular website URL)
2. Verify that:
   - No ShopMy component is shown
   - After saving, the link is created with the product URL as the destination URL

### Test Case 3: ShopMy API Error Handling
1. (Requires modifying code temporarily) Add a line to force an error in the ShopMy API call
2. Create a new link with a ShopMy-eligible URL
3. Verify that:
   - The system gracefully falls back to using the product URL as the destination URL
   - Error messages are properly logged

After completing these tests and verifying that the link creation flow works as expected, we can mark the task as complete.

## Final Implementation - Two-Field Approach for Both Create and Edit Pages

Based on testing feedback, we've redesigned the implementation to have two separate fields in the UI for both the create link and edit link pages:

1. **"Product URL"** - This displays the original product URL entered by the user and is stored in the `originalUrl` field in the database
2. **"Destination URL"** - This shows where users will be redirected to (the ShopMy link or the original URL if ShopMy doesn't apply)

The key changes in this final implementation:

1. Created a dedicated `productUrl` field in the form data via new `link-form-data.ts` file

2. Created a new `ProductUrlInput` component that:
   - Displays as "Product URL" in the UI
   - Stores its value in both the `productUrl` field and `originalUrl` field

3. Reverted the `DestinationUrlInput` component to show "Destination URL" again and only modify the `url` field

4. Created a new combined `LinkUrlFields` component that displays both input fields along with the ShopMy integration in between

5. Updated the ShopMy integration component to work with the `productUrl` field instead of `url`

6. Modified the main link builder form to use the new combined URL fields component

7. Updated the `LinkBuilderProvider` to properly initialize the `productUrl` field from the `originalUrl` field when editing a link, ensuring the edit page shows both fields correctly

8. Fixed the link detail page by:
   - Updating the link detail page client component to use our new `LinkUrlFields` component
   - Ensuring the imports are properly adjusted for the new component structure

This implementation provides a clear separation between:
- The product URL the user wants to share (stored in originalUrl)
- The actual destination URL where users will be redirected (stored in url)

Both the create link and edit link pages now have consistent UI with both fields displayed.

  - [x] Verify edit link page displays correctly

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

I've completely redesigned the implementation to properly display both product URL and destination URL fields in the UI for both the create and edit link pages. The key improvements are:

1. Created a dedicated productUrl field in the form data
2. Built a two-field UI approach with:
   - "Product URL" field at the top (connected to the originalUrl field in database)
   - "Destination URL" field below (connected to the url field in database)
   - ShopMy integration display in between when applicable

3. Fixed the data flow so that:
   - productUrl is always stored in originalUrl in the database
   - Only the destination URL is changed when ShopMy creates an affiliate link
   - The originalUrl field always contains what the user entered as the product URL

4. Ensured the edit link page works consistently with the create link page:
   - Both fields are displayed when editing a link
   - The product URL is initialized from the originalUrl field
   - ShopMy integration is shown for eligible URLs

5. Fixed the link detail page:
   - Updated the page-client.tsx component to use our new LinkUrlFields component
   - Fixed imports to ensure compatibility with the new component structure
   - Ensured consistent UI between create link and edit link pages

The new implementation has been tested and appears to be working correctly. Users can now clearly see both the product URL they entered and the destination URL that will be used for redirection, whether they're creating a new link or editing an existing one.

## Lessons

1. When using utility functions like `currencyFormatter`, be cautious with option values. The `maximumFractionDigits` parameter must be within the range 0-20 as per the Intl.NumberFormat specification. It's often better to use the default formatting options unless specific formatting is required.

## Background and Motivation

We need to create an earnings dashboard in app.thereflist.com that focuses solely on earnings. This dashboard will help users track their affiliate earnings, view trends, and initiate withdrawals. It should be structured similarly to the existing analytics and events pages, but with a specific focus on financial data.

The dashboard should include:
1. A "wallet" module at the top showing available balance, pending earnings, monthly earnings, and a withdraw button
2. Weekly and monthly trendlines for earnings (similar to those in the sales part of the analytics dashboard)
3. Additional relevant financial metrics and visualizations
4. A payouts table showing past and pending payouts

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Existing Infrastructure**: The codebase already has robust functionality for tracking commissions and earnings, primarily in the partners section. We need to adapt this to create a dedicated earnings dashboard.

2. **Data Sources**: 
   - Commission model in Prisma schema tracks earnings with fields for amount, earnings, status, etc.
   - Partner earnings APIs exist for retrieving earnings data, timeseries data, and counts
   - Existing analytics components can be adapted for displaying earnings trends

3. **Missing Components**:
   - No dedicated "wallet" UI component showing available balance
   - No withdrawal functionality for users in the main app interface
   - No dedicated earnings dashboard page

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Need to connect to existing commission/earnings data
   - Need to leverage existing analytics visualization components
   - Need to create new components for wallet and withdrawal functionality

## Components to Reuse from Partners Portal

After exploring the codebase, we've identified the following components that can be reused from the partners.thereflist.com directory:

1. **Earnings Table Component**:
   - `apps/web/app/partners.thereflist.com/(dashboard)/programs/[programSlug]/(enrolled)/earnings/earnings-table.tsx`
   - This component provides a complete table for displaying earnings with columns for date, type, link, customer, sale amount, earnings, and status
   - Uses the `usePartnerEarningsCount` and `useSWR` hooks to fetch data
   - Includes filtering, pagination, and sorting functionality

2. **Earnings Chart Component**:
   - `apps/web/app/partners.thereflist.com/(dashboard)/programs/[programSlug]/(enrolled)/earnings/earnings-composite-chart.tsx`
   - Provides visualizations for earnings data over time
   - Uses the `usePartnerEarningsTimeseries` hook for data
   - Includes date range selection and various filtering options
   - Can switch between different visualization modes (by link or by type)

3. **Payouts Components**:
   - `apps/web/app/partners.thereflist.com/(dashboard)/settings/payouts/payout-table.tsx`
   - `apps/web/ui/partners/amount-row-item.tsx`
   - `apps/web/ui/partners/payout-details-sheet.tsx`
   - These components display payout history, status, and details
   - Include UI for viewing payout status, payout periods, and amounts

4. **API Routes**:
   - `/api/partner-profile/programs/[programId]/earnings` - Gets earnings data
   - `/api/partner-profile/programs/[programId]/earnings/count` - Gets earnings count
   - `/api/partner-profile/programs/[programId]/earnings/timeseries` - Gets time-series earnings data
   - `/api/partner-profile/payouts` - Gets payout data

5. **SWR Hooks**:
   - `apps/web/lib/swr/use-partner-earnings-count.ts` - For counting earnings
   - `apps/web/lib/swr/use-partner-earnings-timeseries.ts` - For timeseries data
   - `apps/web/lib/swr/use-partner-payouts.ts` - For payout data
   - `apps/web/lib/swr/use-partner-payouts-count.ts` - For payout counts

## New Components to Create

1. **Wallet Balance Component**:
   - We need to create a new "wallet" UI component showing:
     - Available balance (sum of processed commissions)
     - Pending earnings (sum of pending commissions)
     - This month's earnings (sum of all commissions in current month)
     - Withdraw button
   - This will aggregate data from the commission table with different status values

2. **Withdrawal Modal/Sheet**:
   - Create a new UI component for initiating withdrawals
   - Similar structure to the existing `payout-details-sheet.tsx` but simplified for user-initiated withdrawals
   - Should show available balance, withdrawal options, and confirmation flow

3. **Earnings Dashboard Page**:
   - Create a new page at `/app.thereflist.com/(dashboard)/[slug]/earnings`
   - Layout similar to analytics page but focused on financial data
   - Will integrate all the components (wallet, charts, tables)

## Backend Requirements

1. **Aggregate Queries**:
   - Create queries to calculate available balance (processed commissions)
   - Create queries to calculate pending earnings (pending commissions)
   - Create queries to calculate current month's earnings

2. **Withdrawal API Endpoint**:
   - Create a new endpoint for initiating withdrawals
   - Integrate with payment processor (similar to existing payout functionality)

## Payouts Table Specifications

The payouts table should:

1. **Display Columns**:
   - Period: The time period covered by the payout
   - Amount: The payout amount
   - Status: Current status of the payout (pending, processing, completed, failed)
   - Date: When the payout was initiated or completed

2. **Functionality**:
   - Show historical payouts with their status
   - Allow filtering by status
   - Sort by date or amount
   - Potentially allow clicking on a payout to see the included commissions

3. **Status Indicators**:
   - Use the existing `PayoutStatusBadges` from the partners UI to show status visually
   - Include tooltips explaining each status

4. **Data Source**:
   - Use the existing Payout model from the Prisma schema
   - Adapt the partner payouts API endpoint for user-specific queries

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Create Earnings Dashboard Page Structure**:
   - Create a new page route at `/app.thereflist.com/(dashboard)/[slug]/earnings`
   - Set up basic page layout similar to analytics and events pages
   - Success criteria: Page is accessible and displays basic structure

2. **Implement Wallet Module**:
   - Adapt earnings data to create a "wallet" component showing:
     - Available balance (sum of processed commissions)
     - Pending earnings (sum of pending commissions)
     - This month's earnings (sum of all commissions in current month)
     - Withdraw button
   - Success criteria: Wallet module displays accurate financial data

3. **Implement Earnings Withdraw Functionality**:
   - Create API endpoint for initiating withdrawals
   - Implement withdrawal flow UI

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

I have implemented the initial UI structure for the earnings dashboard with all the main components:

1. Created the base earnings dashboard page at `/app.thereflist.com/(dashboard)/[slug]/earnings` following the pattern of other dashboard pages like analytics.

2. Implemented the wallet module that displays available balance, pending earnings, and monthly earnings with a withdraw button.

3. Created a withdrawal modal that allows users to initiate a withdrawal with confirmation flow.

4. Implemented an earnings chart based on the partners portal earnings-composite-chart component, with mock data for testing.

5. Created an earnings table based on the partners portal earnings-table component, with mock data and full filtering/sorting functionality.

6. Implemented a payouts table that shows payout history with status indicators and a details view.

7. Added an "Earnings" navigation item to the sidebar menu, using the CircleDollar icon, which will allow users to easily access the earnings dashboard.

All components currently use mock data for testing the UI. The next steps will be:

1. Create the backend API endpoints for retrieving real earnings and payouts data
2. Implement the actual withdrawal functionality
3. Connect the frontend components to the real data sources

The dashboard UI is fully functional with mock data and matches the design patterns and styles of the rest of the application.

# Admin Portal Authentication Debug Plan

## Background and Motivation

We've created an admin user account, but when trying to log into the admin portal with either Google auth or direct login, it redirects back to the standard portal. We've already tried direct login, modifying local hosts, and checked for environment variables. The session doesn't transfer across subdomains. We need a systematic approach to debug this issue and identify why the admin access isn't working properly in the local development environment.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Authentication Flow**: The authentication flow might not be preserving subdomain context or might be forcing redirects to the main application.

2. **Middleware Logic**: The middleware handling admin subdomain access might have specific logic that's not being satisfied.

3. **Session Management**: Sessions might not be properly configured to work across subdomains in development.

4. **Admin Detection**: The admin detection logic might be working differently than we expect.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Review Middleware Code**:
   - Examine the admin middleware code to understand the authentication logic
   - Look for any conditions that would trigger a redirect away from admin portal
   - Success criteria: Understand the exact conditions for admin portal access

2. **Check Authentication Configuration**:
   - Review NextAuth or authentication configuration
   - Check how sessions are managed across subdomains
   - Success criteria: Identify any subdomain-specific session handling

3. **Debug Admin Status Check**:
   - Add logging in middleware to verify the user is correctly identified as admin
   - Check if `isDubAdmin` function returns expected results
   - Success criteria: Confirm the admin detection logic works with our user

4. **Trace Request Flow**:
   - Add tracing/logging to follow request flow through middleware
   - Identify where the redirect happens
   - Success criteria: Pinpoint the exact point where redirect occurs

5. **Test Alternative Access Methods**:
   - Try alternative routes or direct API access to admin functionality
   - Check if admin API endpoints work with our admin user
   - Success criteria: Determine if the issue is UI-specific or applies to all admin access

## Project Status Board

- [ ] Review Middleware Code
  - [ ] Examine `apps/web/lib/middleware/admin.ts`
  - [ ] Review `apps/web/middleware.ts` for subdomain handling
  - [ ] Look for any environment-specific conditions

- [ ] Check Authentication Configuration
  - [ ] Review NextAuth configuration for subdomain handling
  - [ ] Check session cookie settings for domain restrictions
  - [ ] Review callback URL configurations

- [ ] Debug Admin Status Check
  - [ ] Add console logging to `isDubAdmin` function
  - [ ] Verify admin workspace membership in database
  - [ ] Check if middleware correctly identifies admin status

- [ ] Trace Request Flow
  - [ ] Add logging at each step in the middleware and auth process
  - [ ] Trace the HTTP headers and redirect chains
  - [ ] Identify the exact redirect trigger point

- [ ] Test Alternative Access Methods
  - [ ] Try accessing admin API endpoints directly
  - [ ] Check if admin APIs recognize admin privileges
  - [ ] Test different browsers/incognito mode

## Proposed Solutions to Test

1. **Modify Middleware**: Temporarily modify the admin middleware to bypass certain checks or add debug logging

2. **Direct Database Verification**: Query the database to confirm admin status is correctly set up

3. **Local Environment Override**: Add development-specific environment variables to bypass certain checks

4. **Alternative Authentication Method**: Try a different authentication method if available

5. **Force Admin Session**: Create a script to directly set admin session cookies

# Remove Right-Side Modal from Login Page

## Background and Motivation

The current login page shows a customer scroll animation and a link dashboard preview modal on the right side of the login module. This design might be distracting for users who just want to focus on the login process. We need to remove the right-side modal and animation to create a cleaner, more focused login experience that only shows the login module.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Layout Structure**: The login page appears to use a layout with `md:grid-cols-5` where the login module takes 3 columns and the preview takes 2 columns on medium-sized screens and above.

2. **Right-Side Content**: Based on the codebase examination, the right-side content consists of:
   - A BlurImage showing RefList Analytics
   - A scrolling animation with partner/client logos
   - This content is in a div with `hidden md:flex` classes, so it's only visible on medium screens and above

3. **Authentication Layout Component**: The content that needs to be modified appears to be in the `AuthLayout` component which is used as a wrapper for the login page.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Modify AuthLayout Component**:
   - Remove or hide the right-side column content
   - Adjust grid layout to center the login module
   - Success criteria: The login page only shows the login form without the right-side animation and preview

2. **Adjust Responsive Styling**:
   - Update responsive styles to ensure the login module is properly centered on all screen sizes
   - Success criteria: The login module is properly centered on all devices

## Project Status Board

- [x] Modify AuthLayout Component
  - [x] Remove right-side column content from the layout
  - [x] Adjust grid layout to center the login module
  - [x] Test the login page appearance after changes

- [x] Adjust Responsive Styling
  - [x] Update responsive styles for proper centering
  - [x] Test on various screen sizes
  - [x] Ensure mobile view still works correctly

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

I have successfully implemented the changes to remove the right-side modal from the login page. Here's a summary of the modifications made:

1. Removed the right-side column content from the AuthLayout component:
   - Removed the entire div with the `hidden md:flex` classes that contained the RefList Analytics image and partner logos
   - Removed the logos array and BlurImage import that were used for the scrolling animation

2. Adjusted the grid layout to center the login module:
   - Changed the grid from `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-5` to just `grid-cols-1` to create a single-column layout
   - Removed the `sm:col-span-3` class that was setting the column span for the login module on small screens
   - This ensures the login form is centered in the available space

These changes result in a cleaner, more focused login experience with only the essential login form displayed. The component still maintains its responsive behavior for different screen sizes, and the mobile view continues to work correctly as it did before since we only removed content that was hidden on mobile already.

## Lessons

1. When simplifying a UI, it's important to identify the core components that are essential to the user task and remove distracting elements.
2. Grid layouts in Tailwind can be easily adjusted by modifying the grid-cols classes to change how content is distributed.
3. When removing content that's only visible on certain screen sizes (like with `hidden md:flex`), you should check that the responsive design still works properly after the changes. 

# Manual Sales Not Appearing in Events/Analytics Pages

## Background and Motivation

The admin portal supports creating manual sales records, and these sales commission records are successfully created in the database. However, there appears to be an inconsistency in how these records are displayed across the application:

1. The stats widget on the links page correctly shows the manual sale
2. The Events page does not display the manual sale
3. The Analytics page does not display the manual sale

Additionally, there's a network error when navigating to the Analytics tab:
```
Request URL: https://app.thereflist.com/api/customers/undefined?workspaceId=ws_1JT2J2F2XJ9G9M1F77VF7EPAT
Status Code: 404 Not Found
```

This suggests that there might be an issue with how customer data is being fetched or how manual sales events are being propagated to different parts of the application.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Inconsistent Event Display**: The fact that the manual sale appears in the stats widget but not in Events or Analytics pages suggests different data fetching mechanisms or filtering logic.

2. **404 API Error**: The 404 error when fetching customer data with an "undefined" ID indicates a potential issue with how customer data is being passed or retrieved.

3. **Event Propagation**: The system might not be properly associating manual sales with events that should be displayed in the Events and Analytics pages.

4. **Data Model Relationships**: There could be missing relationships between manual sales records and the event tracking system.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Investigate Data Models and Relationships**:
   - Examine how commission records relate to events
   - Check if manual sales are properly tagged or categorized
   - Success criteria: Understand how sales data flows to different UI components

2. **Analyze Data Fetching Mechanisms**:
   - Compare how the stats widget, Events page, and Analytics page fetch data
   - Identify differences in API endpoints or data processing
   - Success criteria: Understand why the stats widget shows the sale but other components don't

3. **Debug Customer API Error**:
   - Trace the request flow for the customer API
   - Identify why the customer ID is undefined
   - Success criteria: Understand the source of the 404 error

4. **Implement Fixes**:
   - Based on findings, implement fixes to ensure consistency
   - Fix any issues with customer data retrieval
   - Success criteria: Manual sales correctly appear in all relevant UI components

## Project Status Board

- [x] Investigate Data Models and Relationships
  - [x] Review commission model schema
  - [x] Examine event tracking system for sales
  - [x] Check how stats widget retrieves sale data
  - [x] Analyze how Events page queries for sales

  - [x] Update event queries to include manual sales
  - [x] Ensure consistent data flow across components

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

After investigating the issue, I've found two key problems:

1. **Missing Tinybird Event Records**: When an admin creates a manual sale record, the system correctly creates a commission record in the database and updates the link statistics (which is why the stats widget shows the sale). However, it's not creating a corresponding event record in Tinybird, which is the data source used by the Events and Analytics pages.

2. **Customer API Error**: The 404 error occurs because when viewing the Analytics page, it's trying to fetch customer information for a sale, but the customer ID is undefined. This happens because manual sales don't have an associated customer record in the system.

### Root Causes:

1. In the admin manual sales recording process (`apps/web/app/api/admin/sales/route.ts`), a commission record is created and link statistics are updated, but there's no call to the `recordSale` or `recordSaleWithTimestamp` functions that would add the event to Tinybird.

2. Unlike regular sales events that come through the tracking system, manual sales don't create or associate with a customer record. The `customerId` field in the commission record is likely null for manual sales.

### Implemented Solutions:

1. **Updated Manual Sale Creation in admin/sales/route.ts**:
   - Created a placeholder customer record for each manual sale if one isn't provided
   - Added Tinybird event creation using `recordSaleWithTimestamp` 
   - Included metadata about the sale being manually created by an admin

2. **Fixed Customer API Error Handling**:
   - Modified `useCustomer` hook to prevent API calls when customerId is undefined
   - Updated `getCustomersMap` in `get-events.ts` to filter out undefined or invalid customer IDs

These changes should ensure that:
1. Manual sales now appear in both the Events and Analytics pages
2. The API doesn't attempt to fetch customer data for invalid customer IDs
3. Each manual sale is properly associated with a customer record

The implementation provides a comprehensive solution that addresses both the root causes of the problem while maintaining data consistency across the application.

## Lessons

1. When implementing a feature that touches multiple data stores (SQL database and Tinybird in this case), ensure data consistency across all systems.
2. Provide fallbacks for cases where data relationships might be incomplete (like missing customer associations).
3. Include comprehensive testing for different data sources and viewing contexts to catch inconsistencies early.
4. Always filter potentially undefined values before making API calls to prevent 404 errors.
5. When creating records in one data store, ensure corresponding records are created in any linked systems. 

# RefList Workspace Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

We're working on debugging issues with manual sales in RefList. The manual sales data is appearing inconsistently across different parts of the application. We need to diagnose and fix these issues to ensure consistent display of manual sales data throughout the platform.

Key reported issues:
1. The manual sales records show up inconsistently across the application
2. A network error when accessing the Analytics tab: `422 Unprocessable Content` for customer data
3. A 500 error when accessing the admin sales API

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Inconsistent Data Display
- ✅ Stats widget on links page (correctly shows the manual sale)
- ✅ Analytics page (sales appear in aggregate statistics)
- ❌ Events page (doesn't display the manual sale as individual events)
- ❌ Earnings page (doesn't show the manual sale)
- ❌ Admin dashboard (shows "error loading sales data")

### API Errors
- 422 Unprocessable Content Error: `https://app.thereflist.com/api/customers?workspaceId=ws_1JT2J2F2XJ9G9M1F77VF7EPAT&search=`
- 500 Error: `https://admin.thereflist.com/api/admin/sales`

### Deleted Commission Records Issue
- Commission records that are deleted are still being shown in the stats widget
- This suggests the Link statistics aren't properly updated when a Commission is deleted

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Investigate 422 Unprocessable Content Error**
   - Examine the API endpoint code for `/api/customers`
   - Check validation logic to identify what's causing the 422 error
   - Success criteria: Root cause of 422 error is identified

2. **Fix Admin Authentication Logic**
   - Review `isDubAdmin` function and its usage in sales API routes
   - Fix parameter mismatch (email vs userId)
   - Success criteria: Admin sales API returns proper data without 500 error

3. **Implement Tinybird Integration Improvements**
   - Add better error handling for Tinybird API calls
   - Add logging to track event submission
   - Success criteria: Manual sales events appear in Events page

4. **Add Customer Record Creation**
   - Create customer record for manual sales if one doesn't exist
   - Fix the customer ID association logic
   - Success criteria: No more 422 errors when loading customer data

5. **Fix Deleted Commission Records Issue**
   - Implement proper updating of Link statistics when a Commission is deleted
   - Success criteria: Deleted commissions no longer appear in stats widget

## Project Status Board

- [ ] 1. Investigate 422 Unprocessable Content Error
- [ ] 2. Fix Admin Authentication Logic
- [ ] 3. Implement Tinybird Integration Improvements
- [ ] 4. Add Customer Record Creation
- [ ] 5. Fix Deleted Commission Records Issue

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

We have identified several interconnected issues that are causing the problems with manual sales:
1. A 422 Unprocessable Content error when fetching customers (updated from previous 404 error)
2. Admin authentication logic mismatch in the sales API
3. Tinybird integration issues affecting event display
4. Missing customer record creation for manual sales
5. Deleted commission records still showing in stats widget
